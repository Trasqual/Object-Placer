# PathCompatible-Object-Placer
 Place prefabs in Scene with ease. And create easy levels with path creator asset.

PathCompatible Object Placer is a Unity custom editor tool that I have created to make level design easier. You can place prefabs on scene objects with colliders. And you can use the free Bezier Path Creator asset by Sebastian Lague (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/b-zier-path-creator-136082) to create easy runner type levels. You can either place objects on the path with an offset or you can define a placement map and auto-generate new levels with a single click on the path.
