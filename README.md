# PathCompatible-Object-Placer
 Place prefabs in Scene with ease. And create easy levels with path creator asset.

PathCompatible Object Placer is a Unity custom editor tool that I have created to make level design easier. You can place prefabs on scene objects with colliders. And you can use the free Bezier Path Creator asset by Sebastian Lague (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/b-zier-path-creator-136082) to create easy runner type levels. You can either place objects on the path with an offset or you can define a placement map and auto-generate new levels with a single click on the path.

You can easily add or remove item type groups such as obstacles and collectables, you can chose which items you want to place and each item group is saved as a scriptable object so you don't lose your settings when you close and re-open your project.

There is also a built-in "Undo" functionality so you can easily ctrl/cmd-z to undo your item placements.
